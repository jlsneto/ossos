DIFFERENT WAY TO HANDLE MATRIX SKINNING

For funky way to handle skeleton that are scaled up & rotated in relation to the mesh
So skeleton & mesh does not match up, so you need a bind + inverseBind & you need to build up

ThreeJS also handles building up the vertices differently by
mul the initial pos by each matrix + weight, Then adding it together.
This might be more efficient since mat * mat is more costly then mat * vec3
but there is one drawback, without a combined boneMatrix, there is no way
to compute the normal matrix in the ossos example.

Either way, this example should be explored, expecially with the idea of using
bind & bindInverse before/after computing the skinned vertex.
Main goal is to first to get the model to render to match skeleton

When the offet exists, the skinned mesh will have a bindMatrix that is identity BUT
will have a bindMatrixInverse that is the invert of the offset transform. This seems
to fix to make it look correct in yUp & in meters.

There may also be weirdness related to the inverse matrices in the gtlf file. The bindpose
might also have the offset built in before the root for all I know.

vec3 transformed = position;
vec4 skinVertex  = bindMatrix * vec4( transformed, 1.0 );

vec4 skinned = vec4( 0.0 );
skinned += boneMatX * skinVertex * skinWeight.x;
skinned += boneMatY * skinVertex * skinWeight.y;
skinned += boneMatZ * skinVertex * skinWeight.z;
skinned += boneMatW * skinVertex * skinWeight.w;

transformed = ( bindMatrixInverse * skinned ).xyz;
